// Bridge is a way to present a single-channel facade over a channel of channels. It is used
// to consume values from a sequence of channels (channel of channels) doing an ordered write
// from different sources. By bridging the channels it destructures the channel of channels
// into a simple channel, allowing to multiplex the input and simplify the consumption.
// With this pattern we can use the channel of channels from within a single range statement
// and focus on our loopâ€™s logic.
